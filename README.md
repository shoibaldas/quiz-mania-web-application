# Getting Started with "QuizMania" React App

This project was developed with react Js.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

And, to build the app we run,

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### Features

I have used these features to build the app,

### `React Dom Router`
### `React Lottie`
### `React Toastify`
### `React Context Api`

These are backend features to develop the app. And I used for fontend component CSS,

### `Tailwind`

For icons, I have used both svg files and also icons from,

### HeroIcons
